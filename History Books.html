                            1807-1930</b> </h6>
                    <p class="card-text"><small style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-muted">Gypsies and the British
                            Imagination, 1807-1930, is the first book to explore fully the British obsession with
                            Gypsies throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth. Deborah Epstein Nord
                            traces various representations of Gypsies in the works of such well-known British authors
                            John Clare, Walter Scott, William Wordsworth, George Eliot, Arthur Conan Doyle, and D. H.
                            Lawrence. Nord also exhumes lesser-known literary, ethnographic, and historical texts,
                            exploring the fascinating histories of nomadic writer George Borrow, the Gypsy Lore Society,
                            Dora Yates, and other rarely examined figures and institutions.

                            Gypsies were both idealized and reviled by Victorian and early-twentieth-century Britons.
                            Associated with primitive desires, lawlessness, cunning, and sexual excess, Gypsies were
                            also objects of antiquarian, literary, and anthropological interest. As Nord demonstrates,
                            British writers and artists drew on Gypsy characters and plots to redefine and reconstruct
                            cultural and racial difference, national and personal identity, and the individual's
                            relationship to social and sexual orthodoxies. Gypsies were long associated with pastoral
                            conventions and, in the nineteenth century, came to stand in for the ancient British past.
                            Using myths of switched babies, Gypsy kidnappings, and the Gypsies' murky origins, authors
                            projected onto Gypsies their own desires to escape convention and their anxieties about the
                            ambiguities of identity. The literary representations that Nord examines have their roots in
                            the interplay between the notion of Gypsies as a separate, often despised race and the
                            psychic or aesthetic desire to dissolve the boundary between English and Gypsy worlds. By
                            the beginning of the twentieth century, she argues, romantic identification with Gypsies had
                            hardened into caricature-a phenomenon reflected in D. H. Lawrence's The Virgin and the
                            Gipsy-and thoroughly obscured the reality of Gypsy life and history.

                            (The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell)</b> </h6>
                    <p class="card-text"><small style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-muted">Master mythologist Joseph
                            Campbell had a genius for finding the unifying symbols and metaphors in apparently distinct
                            cultures and traditions. In Myths of Light: Eastern Metaphors of the Eternal, Campbell
                            explores, with his characteristic clarity and humor, the principle that underlies all the
                            great religions of India and East Asia, from Jainism and Hinduism to Buddhism and Taoism:
                            the transcendent World Soul.

                            Joseph Campbell began his comparative study of the world’s religions with a chance meeting
                            with the renowned Indian theosophist Jeddu Krishnamurti on a trans-Atlantic steamer. Though
                            Campbell was deeply fascinated by mythologies and religions from every continent, Asia’s
                            potent mix of theologies captured his imagination more than any other, and offered him paths
                            to understanding the essence of myth.

                            In Myths of Light, Campbell explores the core philosophies and mythologies of the East,
                            comparing them through vivid examples and stories to each other and to those of the West. A
                            worthy companion to Thou Art That and to Campbell’s Asian Journals, this volume conveys
                            complex insights through warm, accessible storytelling, revealing the intricacies and
                            secrets of his subject with his typical enthusiasm.
