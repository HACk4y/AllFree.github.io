                            1807-1930</b> </h6>
                    <p class="card-text"><small style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-muted">Gypsies and the British
                            Imagination, 1807-1930, is the first book to explore fully the British obsession with
                            Gypsies throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth. Deborah Epstein Nord
                            traces various representations of Gypsies in the works of such well-known British authors
                            John Clare, Walter Scott, William Wordsworth, George Eliot, Arthur Conan Doyle, and D. H.
                            Lawrence. Nord also exhumes lesser-known literary, ethnographic, and historical texts,
                            exploring the fascinating histories of nomadic writer George Borrow, the Gypsy Lore Society,
                            Dora Yates, and other rarely examined figures and institutions.

                            Gypsies were both idealized and reviled by Victorian and early-twentieth-century Britons.
                            Associated with primitive desires, lawlessness, cunning, and sexual excess, Gypsies were
                            also objects of antiquarian, literary, and anthropological interest. As Nord demonstrates,
                            British writers and artists drew on Gypsy characters and plots to redefine and reconstruct
                            cultural and racial difference, national and personal identity, and the individual's
                            relationship to social and sexual orthodoxies. Gypsies were long associated with pastoral
                            conventions and, in the nineteenth century, came to stand in for the ancient British past.
                            Using myths of switched babies, Gypsy kidnappings, and the Gypsies' murky origins, authors
                            projected onto Gypsies their own desires to escape convention and their anxieties about the
                            ambiguities of identity. The literary representations that Nord examines have their roots in
                            the interplay between the notion of Gypsies as a separate, often despised race and the
                            psychic or aesthetic desire to dissolve the boundary between English and Gypsy worlds. By
                            the beginning of the twentieth century, she argues, romantic identification with Gypsies had
                            hardened into caricature-a phenomenon reflected in D. H. Lawrence's The Virgin and the
                            Gipsy-and thoroughly obscured the reality of Gypsy life and history.

                    <p class="card-text"><small style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-muted">Master mythologist Joseph
                            Campbell had a genius for finding the unifying symbols and metaphors in apparently distinct
                            cultures and traditions. In Myths of Light: Eastern Metaphors of the Eternal, Campbell
                            explores, with his characteristic clarity and humor, the principle that underlies all the
                            great religions of India and East Asia, from Jainism and Hinduism to Buddhism and Taoism:
                            the transcendent World Soul.

                            Joseph Campbell began his comparative study of the worldâ€™s religions with a chance meeting
                            with the renowned Indian theosophist Jeddu Krishnamurti on a trans-Atlantic steamer. Though
                            Campbell was deeply fascinated by mythologies and religions from every continent, Asiaâ€™s
                            potent mix of theologies captured his imagination more than any other, and offered him paths
                            to understanding the essence of myth.

                            In Myths of Light, Campbell explores the core philosophies and mythologies of the East,
                            comparing them through vivid examples and stories to each other and to those of the West. A
                            worthy companion to Thou Art That and to Campbellâ€™s Asian Journals, this volume conveys
                            complex insights through warm, accessible storytelling, revealing the intricacies and
                            secrets of his subject with his typical enthusiasm.

                        John von Neumann (1903-1957) was unquestionably one of the most brilliant scientists of the twentieth century. He made major contributions to quantum mechanics and mathematical physics and in 1943 began a new and all-too-short career in computer science. William Aspray provides the first broad and detailed account of von Neumann's many different contributions to computing. These, Aspray reveals, extended far beyond his well-known work in the design and construction of computer systems to include important scientific applications, the revival of numerical analysis, and the creation of a theory of computing.Aspray points out that from the beginning von Neumann took a wider and more theoretical view than other computer pioneers. In the now famous EDVAC report of 1945, von Neumann clearly stated the idea of a stored program that resides in the computer's memory along with the data it was to operate on. This stored program computer was described in terms of idealized neurons, highlighting the analogy between the digital computer and the human brain. Aspray describes von Neumann's development during the next decade, and almost entirely alone, of a theory of complicated information processing systems, or automata, and the introduction of themes such as learning, reliability of systems with unreliable components, self-replication, and the importance of memory and storage capacity in biological nervous systems; many of these themes remain at the heart of current investigations in parallel or neurocomputing.Aspray allows the record to speak for itself. He unravels an intricate sequence of stories generated by von Neumann's work and brings into focus the interplay of personalities centered about von Neumann. He documents the complex interactions of science, the military, and business and shows how progress in applied mathematics was intertwined with that in computers.
                        
                        William Aspray is Director of the Center for the History of Electrical Engineering at The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

                    <p class="card-text"><small style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-muted">In 1944, Britain led the world in electronic computing. By 1974, the British computer industry was all but extinct. What happened in the intervening thirty years holds lessons for all postindustrial superpowers. As Britain struggled to use technology to retain its global power, the nation's inability to manage its technical labor force hobbled its transition into the information age. 

                        In Programmed Inequality, Mar Hicks explores the story of labor feminization and gendered technocracy that undercut British efforts to computerize. That failure sprang from the government's systematic neglect of its largest trained technical workforce simply because they were women. Women were a hidden engine of growth in high technology from World War II to the 1960s. As computing experienced a gender flip, becoming male-identified in the 1960s and 1970s, labor problems grew into structural ones and gender discrimination caused the nation's largest computer userâ€”the civil service and sprawling public sectorâ€”to make decisions that were disastrous for the British computer industry and the nation as a whole.
                        
                        Drawing on recently opened government files, personal interviews, and the archives of major British computer companies, Programmed Inequality takes aim at the fiction of technological meritocracy. Hicks explains why, even today, possessing technical skill is not enough to ensure that women will rise to the top in science and technology fields. Programmed Inequality shows how the disappearance of women from the field had grave macroeconomic consequences for Britain, and why the United States risks repeating those errors in the twenty-first century.
