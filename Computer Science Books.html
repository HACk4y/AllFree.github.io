                    <p class="card-text"><small style="font-size: 14px;" class="text-muted">From the author of Mind
                            Hacking and founder of
                            Bitcoin Market Journal comes the first book to explain the money-making secrets behind
                            bitcoin and blockchain in a user-friendly format.

                            When John Hargrave first invested in cryptocurrency, the price of a single bitcoin was about
                            $125; a few years later, that same bitcoin was worth $20,000. He wasn’t alone: this flood of
                            new money is like the early days of the Internet, creating a new breed of “blockchain
                            billionaires.”

                            Sir John has unlocked their secrets.

                            In Blockchain for Everyone, Sir John reveals the formula for investing in bitcoin and
                            blockchain, using real-life stories, easy-to-understand examples, and a healthy helping of
                            humor. Packed with illustrations, Blockchain for Everyone explains how (and when) to buy
                            bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and other blockchain assets, with step-by-step instructions.

                            Blockchain for Everyone is the first blockchain investing book written for the layperson: a
                            guide that helps everyone understand how to build wealth wisely. It’s the new investing
                            manifesto!

                            Service with vCloud Director

                            Empowered by virtualization, companies are not just moving into the cloud, they're moving
                            into private clouds for greater security, flexibility, and cost savings. However, this move
                            involves more than just infrastructure. It also represents a different business model and a
                            new way to provide services. In this detailed book, VMware vExpert Simon Gallagher makes
                            sense of private cloud computing for IT administrators. From basic cloud theory and
                            strategies for adoption to practical implementation, he covers all the issues. You'll learn
                            how to build a private cloud and deliver it as a service using VMware vCloud Director 5.1.

                            Consider what it takes to transition to the cloud, including the business, technical, and

                            Measure the impact of a private cloud on your legacy applications and infrastructure
                            Implement efficient operations—learn how to apply automation, set up backup and restore, and

                            Representing an evolutionary leap forward for CSS, CSS3 is chock-full of new capabilities
                            that dramatically expand the boundaries of what a styling language can do. But many of those
                            new features remain undocumented, making it difficult to learn what they are and how to use
                            them to create the sophisticated sites and web apps clients demand and users have grown to
                            expect.

                            Until now.

                            This book introduces you to all of CSS3’s new and advanced features, and, with the help of
                            dozens of real-world examples and live demos, it shows how to use those features to design
                            dazzling, fully-responsive sites and web apps.

                            Among other things, you’ll learn how to:

                            • Use advanced selectors and an array of powerful new text tools

                            management practices.

                            Data management is data lifecycle management
                            Different data types have different lifecycle requirements
                            Data management includes the management of risks associated with data
                            Data management requirements should drive information technology decisions

                            Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs</b> </h6>
                    <p class="card-text"><small style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-muted">An insider's account of
                            Apple's creative process during the golden years of Steve Jobs.

                            Hundreds of millions of people use Apple products every day; several thousand work on
                            Apple's campus in Cupertino, California; but only a handful sit at the drawing board.
                            Creative Selection recounts the life of one of the few who worked behind the scenes, a
                            highly-respected software engineer who worked in the final years of the Steve Jobs era―the
                            Golden Age of Apple.

                            Ken Kocienda offers an inside look at Apple’s creative process. For fifteen years, he was on
                            the ground floor of the company as a specialist, directly responsible for experimenting with
                            novel user interface concepts and writing powerful, easy-to-use software for products
                            including the iPhone, the iPad, and the Safari web browser. His stories explain the
                            symbiotic relationship between software and product development for those who have never
                            dreamed of programming a computer, and reveal what it was like to work on the cutting edge
                            of technology at one of the world's most admired companies.

                            Kocienda shares moments of struggle and success, crisis and collaboration, illuminating each
                            with lessons learned over his Apple career. He introduces the essential elements of
                            innovation―inspiration, collaboration, craft, diligence, decisiveness, taste, and
                            empathy―and uses these as a lens through which to understand productive work culture.

                            An insider's tale of creativity and innovation at Apple, Creative Selection shows readers
                            how a small group of people developed an evolutionary design model, and how they used this
                            methodology to make groundbreaking and intuitive software which countless millions use every
                            day.
