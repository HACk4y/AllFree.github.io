                    <p class="card-text"><small style="font-size: 14px;" class="text-muted">From the author of Mind
                            Hacking and founder of
                            Bitcoin Market Journal comes the first book to explain the money-making secrets behind
                            bitcoin and blockchain in a user-friendly format.

                            When John Hargrave first invested in cryptocurrency, the price of a single bitcoin was about
                            $125; a few years later, that same bitcoin was worth $20,000. He wasn’t alone: this flood of
                            new money is like the early days of the Internet, creating a new breed of “blockchain
                            billionaires.”

                            Sir John has unlocked their secrets.

                            In Blockchain for Everyone, Sir John reveals the formula for investing in bitcoin and
                            blockchain, using real-life stories, easy-to-understand examples, and a healthy helping of
                            humor. Packed with illustrations, Blockchain for Everyone explains how (and when) to buy
                            bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and other blockchain assets, with step-by-step instructions.

                            Blockchain for Everyone is the first blockchain investing book written for the layperson: a
                            guide that helps everyone understand how to build wealth wisely. It’s the new investing
                            manifesto!

                            Empowered by virtualization, companies are not just moving into the cloud, they're moving
                            into private clouds for greater security, flexibility, and cost savings. However, this move
                            involves more than just infrastructure. It also represents a different business model and a
                            new way to provide services. In this detailed book, VMware vExpert Simon Gallagher makes
                            sense of private cloud computing for IT administrators. From basic cloud theory and
                            strategies for adoption to practical implementation, he covers all the issues. You'll learn
                            how to build a private cloud and deliver it as a service using VMware vCloud Director 5.1.

                            Consider what it takes to transition to the cloud, including the business, technical, and

                            value of effective data management.
                            Today's organizations recognize that data management is critical to their
                            success. They recognize that data has value and want to leverage that value. As our ability
                            and desire to create and exploit data has increased, so has the need for reliable data
                            management practices.

                            Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs</b> </h6>
                    <p class="card-text"><small style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-muted">An insider's account of
                            Apple's creative process during the golden years of Steve Jobs.

                            Hundreds of millions of people use Apple products every day; several thousand work on
                            Apple's campus in Cupertino, California; but only a handful sit at the drawing board.
                            Creative Selection recounts the life of one of the few who worked behind the scenes, a
                            highly-respected software engineer who worked in the final years of the Steve Jobs era―the
                            Golden Age of Apple.

                            Ken Kocienda offers an inside look at Apple’s creative process. For fifteen years, he was on
                            the ground floor of the company as a specialist, directly responsible for experimenting with
                            novel user interface concepts and writing powerful, easy-to-use software for products
                            including the iPhone, the iPad, and the Safari web browser. His stories explain the
                            symbiotic relationship between software and product development for those who have never
                            dreamed of programming a computer, and reveal what it was like to work on the cutting edge
                            of technology at one of the world's most admired companies.

                            Kocienda shares moments of struggle and success, crisis and collaboration, illuminating each
                            with lessons learned over his Apple career. He introduces the essential elements of
                            innovation―inspiration, collaboration, craft, diligence, decisiveness, taste, and
                            empathy―and uses these as a lens through which to understand productive work culture.

                            An insider's tale of creativity and innovation at Apple, Creative Selection shows readers
                            how a small group of people developed an evolutionary design model, and how they used this
                            methodology to make groundbreaking and intuitive software which countless millions use every
                            day.

                    <p class="card-text"><small style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-muted">The 2012 National Research Council report Continuing Innovation in Information Technology illustrates how fundamental research in information technology (IT), conducted at industry and universities, has led to the introduction of entirely new product categories that ultimately became billion-dollar industries. The central graphic from that report portrays and connects areas of major investment in basic research, university-based research, and industry research and development; the introduction of important commercial products resulting from this research; billion-dollar-plus industries stemming from it; and present-day IT market segments and representative U.S. firms whose creation was stimulated by the decades-long research.

                        At a workshop hosted by the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board on March 5, 2015, leading academic and industry researchers and industrial technologists described key research and development results and their contributions and connections to new IT products and industries, and illustrated these developments as overlays to the 2012 "tire tracks" graphic. The principal goal of the workshop was to collect and make available to policy makers and members of the IT community first-person narratives that illustrate the link between government investments in academic and industry research to the ultimate creation of new IT industries. This report provides summaries of the workshop presentations organized into five broad themes - (1) fueling the innovation pipeline, (2) building a connected world, (3) advancing the hardware foundation, (4) developing smart machines, and (5) people and computers - and ends with a summary of remarks from the concluding panel discussion.
