                            be clear about what this book isn’t. If you’re looking for a book that offers a method for
                            mastering a language in few simple steps, this isn’t it. If you want a book that can make

                            language learning resource promising those kinds of things, throw them away. Learning a new
                            language takes time and dedication. Unless you’re gifted, there’s no shortcut.

                            Mastering another language can be challenging but the reward is definitely worth it. Let
                            Italian language learning be your guide in your Italian language learning journey.

                            With German Short Stories: 9 Simple and Captivating Stories for Effective German Learning
                            for Beginners, you will experience a relief from the frustrations you might have experienced
                            when trying to learn German through a more rigid approach.

                            In this book, you will encounter rich and new but not too complex vocabulary, which is
                            translated at the end of the chapter, avoiding the hassle of having to stop the reading
                            rhythm to look up every word in the dictionary. Every paragraph is translated, as well as
                            the summary of the story, thus providing a clearer comprehension of each sentence, while
                            trying to prevent the temptation that the reader might have, if discouraged, of giving up
                            and reading the whole story in English.

                            After each chapter, there is a question section, which aims to test the reader’s overall
                            understanding of the story, containing both open-ended and multiple-choice questions. The
                            solved questions are provided at the end, enabling you to check your own answers and,
                            consequently, develop your skills.
