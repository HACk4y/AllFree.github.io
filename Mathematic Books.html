                            mathematicians and including material on both elementary and advanced levels, encompasses 20

                            sophisticated developement. As Professor Morris Kline of New York University noted, "This

                            Beginning with an overview and analysis of mathematics, the first of three major divisions
                            of the book progresses to an exploration of analytic geometry, algebra, and ordinary
                            differential equations. The second part introduces partial differential equations, along
                            with theories of curves and surfaces, the calculus of variations, and functions of a complex
                            variable. It furthur examines prime numbers, the theory of probability, approximations, and

                            Thorough, coherent explanations of each topic are further augumented by numerous

                            abridgement. Using the text established by Heiberg, Sir Thomas Heath encompasses almost
                            2,500 years of mathematical and historical study upon Euclid.
                            This unabridged republication of the original enlarged edition contains the complete English
                            text of all 13 books of the Elements, plus a critical apparatus that analyzes each
                            definition, postulate, and proposition in great detail. It covers textual and linguistic
                            matters; mathematical analyses of Euclid’s ideas; classical, medieval, Renaissance, modern
                            commentators; refutations, supports, extrapolations, reinterpretations, and historical
                            notes, all given with extensive quotes.
                            “The textbook that shall really replace Euclid has not yet been written and probably never
                            will be.” — Encyclopaedia Britannica.
                            Volume 1. 151-page Introduction: life and other works of Euclid; Greek and Islamic
                            commentators; surviving mss., scholia, translations; bases of Euclid’s thought. Books I and
                            II of the Elements, straight lines, angles, intersection of lines, triangles,
                            parallelograms, etc.
                            Volume 2. Books III-IX: Circles, tangents, segments, figures described around and within
                            circles, rations, proportions, magnitudes, polygons, prime numbers, products, plane and
                            solid numbers, series of rations, etc.
                            Volume 3. Books X to XIII: planes, solid angles, etc.; method of exhaustion in similar
                            polygons within circles, pyramids, cones, cylinders, spheres, etc. Appendix: Books XIV, XV,

                            This major survey of mathematics, featuring the work of 18 outstanding Russian
                            mathematicians and including material on both elementary and advanced levels, encompasses 20
                            prime subject areas in mathematics in terms of their simple origins and their subsequent
                            sophisticated developement. As Professor Morris Kline of New York University noted, "This
                            unique work presents the amazing panorama of mathematics proper. It is the best answer in

                            Beginning with an overview and analysis of mathematics, the first of three major divisions
                            of the book progresses to an exploration of analytic geometry, algebra, and ordinary
                            differential equations. The second part introduces partial differential equations, along
                            with theories of curves and surfaces, the calculus of variations, and functions of a complex
                            variable. It furthur examines prime numbers, the theory of probability, approximations, and
                            the role of computers in mathematics. The theory of functions of a real variable opens the
                            final section, followed by discussions of linear algebra and nonEuclidian geometry,
                            topology, functional analysis, and groups and other algebraic systems.
                            Thorough, coherent explanations of each topic are further augumented by numerous
                            illustrative figures, and every chapter concludes with a suggested reading list. Formerly
                            issued as a three-volume set, this mathematical masterpiece is now available in a convenient
